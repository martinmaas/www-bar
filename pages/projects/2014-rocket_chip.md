BLURB: Rocket Chip is Berkeley's RISC-V based SOC generator.  The <a href="http://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip/">open-source release</a> is capable of generating a multi-core system with Rocket scalar cores, Z-Scale control processors, and a coherent memory system.
------

[Rocket Chip](http://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip/) is BAR's paramaterizable
chip generator, and serves as the basis for all the RISC-V implementations that
we produce.  [Rocket Chip](http://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip) can generate a
RTL RISC-V implementation that has virtual memory, a coherent multi-level cache
hierarchy, IEEE-compliant floating-point units, and all the relevant
infastructure to talk to a running system. 

The best description of how to get started with Rocket Chip is the
[README](http://github.com/ucb-bar/rocket-chip/blob/master/README.md).
