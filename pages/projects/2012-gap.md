BLURB: The Berkeley <a href="http://gap.cs.berkeley.edu">Graph Algorithm Platform (GAP) Project</a> spans the entire stack, and it aims to accelerate graph algorithms through software optimization and hardware acceleration.
------

Graph algorithms are becoming increasingly important, with applications covering a wide range of scales. Warehouse-scale computers use graph algorithms to reason about vast amounts of data for analytics and recommendation systems. Mobile clients use graph algorithms as important components of recognition and machine-learning applications.

Some of the outcomes from the GAP project so far are:

+ [Direction-Optimizing Breadth-First Search](http://gap.cs.berkeley.edu/dobfs.html) - fastest BFS for low-diameter graphs
+ [GAP Benchmark Suite](http://gap.cs.berkeley.edu/benchmark.html) - standardize evaluations with specification + reference code
+ [GBSP](http://gap.cs.berkeley.edu/gbsp.html) - graph DSL embedded in Python that achieves native performance thanks to [SEJITS](http://sejits.org)
