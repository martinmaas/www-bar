BLURB:  ASPIRE is a new 5-year research project that recognizes the shift from transistor-scaling-driven performance improvements to a new post-scaling world where whole-stack co-design is the key to improved efficiency. Building on the success of the <a href="http://parlab.eecs.berkeley.edu">Par Lab</a> project, it uses deep hardware and software co-tuning to achieve the highest possible performance and energy efficiency for future warehouse-scale and mobile computing systems.
