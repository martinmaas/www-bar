BLURB: The <a href="http://hwacha.org">Hwacha</a> project is developing a new vector architecture for future computer systems that are constrained in their power and energy consumption.
------
Inspired by traditional vector machines from the 70s and 80s, and lessons learned from our previous vector-thread architectures Scale and Maven, we are bringing back elegant, performant, and energy-efficient aspects of vector processing to modern data-parallel architectures. We propose a new vector-fetch architectural paradigm, which focuses on the following aspects for higher performance, better energy efficiency, and lower complexity.

+ Hide Memory Latency with Decoupling for Better Efficiency.

+ Exploit Operand Uniformity with Scalarization.

+ Handle Control Flow Efficiently with Predication.

+ Support Mixed-Precision Seamlessly.

+ Optimize for Temporal Operand Re-Usage.

+ OS-Friendly from the Ground Up.

We are currently working towards an open-source release of the hardware and software toolchain.
