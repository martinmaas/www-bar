BLURB: BOOM is Berkeley's out-of-order core generator. Our goal is to provide a readable, open-source implementatino for use in education, research, and industry.
------

[BOOM](http://github.com/ucb-bar/riscv-boom) is a synthesizable, parameterized,
superscalar out-of-order RISC-V core designed to serve as the prototypical
baseline processor for future micro-architectural studies of out-of-order
processors. 

BOOM is written in roughly 9,000 lines of the hardware construction language
Chisel. We leveraged Berkeleyâ€™s open-source Rocket-chip SoC generator, allowing
us to quickly bring up an entire multi-core processor system (including caches
and uncore) by replacing the in-order Rocket core with an out-of-order BOOM
core. BOOM supports atomics, IEEE 754-2008 floating-point, and page-based
virtual memory. We have demonstrated BOOM running Linux, SPEC CINT2006, and
CoreMark.
