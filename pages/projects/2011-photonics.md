BLURB: Todayâ€™s computers are largely limited by the amount of information they can communicate at every level of system hierarchy: the processor chip, server blade, rack and data-center. Silicon photonics is an emerging technology with the potential to overcome traditional communication limitations. We are leveraging the high-bandwidth density and low-energy use of photonic interconnects to prototype and build new electronic-photonic chips and systems.

For more information on the software toolchain, please take a look at
the [RISC-V project
page](http://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/2010-riscv.html).  The
processor RTL has been instantiated from the [Rocket Chip SoC
Generator](http://bar.eecs.berkeley.edu/projects/2014-rocket_chip.html).
