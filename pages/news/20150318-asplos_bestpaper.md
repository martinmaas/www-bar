The ASPLOS 2015 Best Paper Award was presented to Chang Liu, Austin Harris, Martin Maas, Michael Hicks, Mohit Tiwari, and Elaine Shi for “GhostRider: A Hardware-Software System for Memory Trace Oblivious Computation”.

Martin Maas is a graduate student in the Berkeley Architecture Research Group, and Mohit Tiwari was a postdoc in the group before taking his current faculty position at UT Austin. The paper authors includes members from University of Maryland, University of Texas at Austin, and University of California, Berkeley.

The paper looks at a combined hardware/software approach to providing efficient secure computation and uses the Berkeley-developed Rocket RISC-V infrastructure running on a Convey FPGA system for evaluation.

Congratulations to the whole team!
