FORCETITLE: Berkeley Architecture Research

Welcome to the UC Berkeley Architecture Research homepage.

Computer architecture research has a long history in the Berkeley EECS
department, dating back to the CALDIC computer finished in 1951 (one
noted alumnus of the CALDIC project was Douglas Engelbart, who would
go on to invent the computer mouse).  Other notable computer
architecture projects include Project Genie, RISC-I, RISC-II, SOAR,
SPUR, RAID, VLSI-BAM, T0, NOW, IRAM, and RAMP.  Berkeley computer
architecture research has always emphasized construction of
prototypes, and this continues to this day with multiple
microprocessor tapeouts in advanced processes every year.  All recent
microprocessor designs have been based on the RISC-V instruction set
and are implementing using the Chisel Hardware Description language,
both developed at Berkeley.

These pages are still currently under construction, so stay tuned!

We would like to thank the long list of past and present sponsors who
have made this work possible, including: DARPA, NSF, DoE, ONR, C-FAR,
Intel, Google, HP, Huawei, IBM, LGE, Microsoft, National Instruments,
NEC, Nokia, NVIDIA, Oracle, Samsung, ST Microelectronics, TSMC, and
Xilinx.
