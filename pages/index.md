TITLE: Berkeley Architecture Research
SHOWON: index
SPONSORS: all

Here's what goes at the start of the main page... 

# TODO
* I can't read anything, the fonts are all small and gray
* Replace the logo with something good
* Get a sponsor list
* Write headers for all the pages (News, Projects, History, Publications, People)
* Get everyone to write a project blurb
* Seed the news entries with something interesting
* Get a list of publications
* Get a list of people, and add sub-menu entries
* Get someone to write some stuff about the history of UCB-BAR 
* It seems like the projects should be ordered newest to oldest, instead of vice versa?
* Probably we should add a page for graduated people as well.
* Seems odd that some links (e.g., people's names) are blue and others are not.
* The projects page seems very claustrophobic - can we spread it out a bit?
