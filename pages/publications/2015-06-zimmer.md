------
This work demonstrates a RISC-V vector microprocessor implemented in 28nm FDSOI with fully-integrated non-interleaved switched-capacitor DCDC (SC-DCDC) converters and adaptive clocking that generates four on-chip voltages between 0.5V and 1V using only 1.0V core and 1.8V IO voltage inputs.
The design pushes the capabilities of dynamic voltage scaling by enabling fast transitions (20ns), simple packaging (no off-chip passives), low area overhead (16%), high conversion efficiency (80-86%), and high energy efficiency (26.2 DP GFLOPS/W) for mobile devices.
