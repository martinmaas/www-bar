------

David is a student in the [ASPIRE Lab](https://aspire.eecs.berkeley.edu) at
UC Berkeley, interested anything loosely related to digital system design from
CAD to circuits. Specifically, energy efficient memory-hierarchies and
memory controller architectures. He is presently working on supporting memory
models in MIDAS.

David graduated from the University of Toronto in 2014, with a BASc. in
Engineering Science (ECE option). His undergraduate thesis was supervised by
Professor [Jonathan Rose](http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jayar/) and studied a
fine-grain system-integration tool called
[GENIE](http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jayar/software/GENIE/) that automates
interconnect generation at low-levels of the design hierarchy.
