------
As of November 2015, I am a fourth year Ph.D student in [Computer
Science](http://eecs.berkeley.edu) at the [University of California:
Berkeley](http://berkeley.edu), being advised by [Krste
Asanovic](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/) and [Jonathan
Bachrach](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrb/).  I am currently a
member of the [ASPIRE](http://aspire.eecs.berkeley.edu) project.  My
office is currently located in the ASPIRE lab (previously the Par
Lab), which is on the 5th floor of Soda Hall.  As there aren't really
room numbers, I've highlighted a
[map](http://www.dabbelt.com/~palmer/assets/parlab_seat.png).

I graduated in 2011 from the [University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/) with a B.S. in Electrical and
Computer Engineering, where I was advised by [Sanjay
Patel](http://users.crhc.illinois.edu/sjp/) and [Steve
Lumetta](http://users.crhc.illinois.edu/steve/).

My [calendar](http://www.dabbelt.com/~palmer/calendar.html) is availiable
online and is generally kept up-to-date. Unless otherwise specified, blue
events are on campus while all other colors are off campus. I am generally in
my office when I'm on campus, but you should schedule a meeting ahead of time
if possible.
